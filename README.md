# Personal Website Api
A server built using express js to handle email from a website. 
This project is based on a tutorial by [Garrett Love](https://github.com/garrettlove8/building-react-portfolio) but with several upgrades :
 * including async await instead of promises,
 * use of the dotenv dependency to handle process.env variables, 
 * and a work around to handle twilios rejection of emails from address's other than your own.
